    "\n",
    "This notebook presents a solution to build an agent using [CrewAI](https://docs.crewai.com/introduction). CrewAI enables you to create AI teams where each agent has specific roles, tools, and goals, working together to accomplish complex tasks. \n",

    "As a part of this solution, we will build a simple code generation agent that can use some content within a knowledge base and self reflection to provide executable and correct code. "
